    "\n",
    "A typical transformation-based compression algorithm involves the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. __Signal capture__: \n",
    "    Fully sense a whole __raw__ signal $x$ and store it. In this project $x$ are the _voltages_ measured by the ECG machine.\n",
    "2. __Transformation to a sparse domain__:\n",
    "    The signal $x$ is transformed to a sparse domain, basically we want to find the sparse vector $s \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$, that contain mostly negligible coefficients.\n",
    "\n",
    "    We exploit $\\Psi \\in \\mathbb{C}^{n \\times n}$ orthogonal basis matrix, also called __dictionary__. Being $\\Psi$ an orthonormal basis, it satisfies $\\Psi^H \\Psi = I$, where $\\Psi^H$ is the Hermitian conjugate (conjugate transpose) of $\\Psi$, and $I$ is the identity matrix. This implies that $\\Psi^{-1} = \\Psi^H$, making the transformation and its inverse straightforward.\n",
    "\n",

    "    On a mathematical note: $\\Psi$ is an orthonormal basis composed of functions like Fourier Function, Wavelet, and so on.\n",
    "    The actual computation of $s$ doesn't actually build a dictionary $\\Psi$ to invert and multiplicate to the signal. Instead it directly applies the _transform_ (e.g. FFT, DWT, DCT, ...) to the signal $x$, to immediately obtain _sparse representation_ $s$.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. __Sparsification__: \n",
    "    A fundamental concept is that a threshold is applied to the coefficients, retaining only those that are significant (i.e., above the threshold) and discarding the rest.\n",
    "\n",
    "    A more detailed view reveals that these steps can be performed using a wide range of techniques, depending on the transform employed, and equivalently, on the choice of dictionary.\n",

    "The *Method of Optimal Directions (MOD)* is an iterative algorithm where, at each iteration, the goal is to update the dictionary to minimize the reconstruction error given the current sparse coefficients. The dictionary is updated by solving a least-squares problem. This method is particularly efficient when the training set is well-chosen and representative of the signals to be compressed. In this context, MOD generates a dictionary that provides a better sparse representation of the ECG signal, especially when the characteristics of the signal are stable over time, such as in the case of patient-specific ECG data.\n",
    "\n",
    "*K-Singular Value Decomposition (K-SVD)*, on the other hand, is another adaptive dictionary learning technique that builds on the principles of the MOD algorithm but further refines the dictionary update step. In K-SVD, the dictionary atoms are updated one at a time through a singular value decomposition process. This method improves the sparsity of the signal representation by optimizing both the sparse coefficients and the dictionary atoms simultaneously. K-SVD is known for its flexibility and ability to handle complex signals, making it a suitable candidate for ECG signal compression where achieving higher sparsity can significantly improve the reconstruction quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both methods allow for the creation of a more tailored dictionary compared to fixed ones, such as DCT, leading to a sparser representation of the ECG data. This sparser representation compensates for the reduction in the size of the measurement matrix, helping to maintain or improve the quality of the reconstructed signal. These adaptive techniques are particularly advantageous in scenarios where the signal remains relatively consistent over time, such as in long-term ECG monitoring, offering a substantial improvement over fixed dictionaries.\n",

The ℓ0 norm represents the number of non-zero elements in a vector, which directly captures sparsity, but solving the ℓ0-minimization problem is NP-hard. To address this, SL0 approximates the ℓ0 norm using a smooth function, which is easier to minimize.\n",

This allows the algorithm to efficiently find sparse solutions by iteratively refining the approximation.\n",

    "1. **Initialization**: The algorithm starts by choosing an initial estimate for the sparse coefficients, typically based on a least-squares solution.\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **Smoothing and gradient descent**: A smooth approximation of the ℓ0 norm is applied, and a gradient descent method is used to minimize the smooth function. This step leads to a sparsity-promoting solution.\n",
    "   \n",
    "3. **Progressive narrowing**: The smooth function is gradually made less smooth (narrower) over iterations, which more closely approximates the true ℓ0 norm. As the smoothing parameter decreases, the solution becomes sparser.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Stopping criterion**: The algorithm stops once the approximation is sufficiently narrow or a desired level of sparsity is achieved.\n",
    "\n",
    "SL0 is particularly appealing because it avoids the more computationally expensive ℓ1-minimization while still producing sparse solutions. It also directly incorporates noise tolerance by allowing a relaxation of the equality constraint, as in the standard compressed sensing problem:\n",

    "The Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) is a transform similar to the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) but uses only real numbers and cosines. It is widely used in image and video compression (e.g., JPEG, MPEG) due to its properties that are particularly suitable for these applications.\n",

    "The Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) has a key property known as energy compaction, where most of the signal's energy is concentrated in a few low-frequency components.

    "\n",
    "In the DCT, the index $k$ represents the frequency component. Low values of $k$ correspond to low-frequency components, which represent slow variations in the signal, while high values of $k$ correspond to high-frequency components, representing rapid variations.\n",

    "- __Downsampling__: After filtering, the signal is downsampled by a factor of 2 (keeping every other sample) to reduce the data size.\n",

    "The physicians' qualitative assessments provided a subjective but clinically relevant measure of how much distortion could be tolerated in the reconstructed signals before it began to interfere with accurate diagnosis. These evaluations were then correlated with specific PRD values, allowing the researchers to define thresholds where the signal quality was deemed acceptable or unacceptable for clinical use. For instance, a PRD of less than 2% was consistently associated with minimal diagnostic distortion, leading to its classification as \"Very Good.\" As PRD increased, the likelihood of clinically significant distortion also increased, which was reflected in the \"Good\" and \"Undetermined\" categories.\n",
