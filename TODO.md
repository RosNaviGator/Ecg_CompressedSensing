# TO DO LIST

## DO not forget at the end ...
- `pip freze > requirements.txt` to generate req list at the end
- `python --version > py_version.txt` to tell which version of python was employed
- Add tutorial/single_scripts to install correct version of python and packages


## If you have the time
While working from scratch `.ipynb` notebooks are a good solution, they allow you to test right away, they allow you to add markdown blocks of notes, and so on ..  But for portabilty, version checking on GitHub, ... it is more advisable to have `.py` scripts. I will work now on Jupyter Notebook, but in the future it could make sense to make `.py` scripts and publish only/also them on GitHub
