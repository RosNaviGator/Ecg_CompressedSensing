## If you have the time
- While working from scratch `.ipynb` notebooks are a good solution, they allow you to test right away, they allow you to add markdown blocks of notes, and so on ..  But for portabilty, version checking on GitHub, ... it is more advisable to have `.py` scripts. I will work now on Jupyter Notebook, but in the future it could make sense to make `.py` scripts and publish only/also them on GitHub
- EXPERIMENT with wfdb.download that allows you to directly download dataset from physionet.org within python!
